# Movies-ETL - Challenge 8 
This challenge consisted of building a function which automated the processes discussed in this module. Python 3.7 with the Anaconda (Pandas) package was used to perform the analysis. A python file containing the function can be found in this repository. 

The processes were aimed at importing JSON and CSV files, cleaning the data by eliminating null values, and eliminating redundicies within the data, creating data tables through merging cleaned data sets, and then exporting these data tables into PostgreSQL.

A final step was considered which consisted of utilizing try-except block to account for unforeseen problems that may arise in the event that the data changes, whether that being structure wise, or formatting wise. 

The following assumptions were made and were accounted for in the function discussed above:
